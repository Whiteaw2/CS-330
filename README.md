Computer Graphics and Visualization with OpenGL

**How do I approach designing software?**
One of the most important parts of approaching any problem is taking stock of the required features and requirements. After I've created a clear list of all requirements and features, I will consider the general architecture, languages, libraries, and any additional requirements that may not have been explicitly expressed by the client, but which will be required for success such as network security considerations. From this point, it's important to think about what dependencies exist between and outside of the classes in the architecture, and to identify additional requirements or considerations. Next, outlining several UML documents and reviewing them with the client ensures that I reduce the chance of missing requirements. Then, once requirements are fully understood, I will begin prototyping and stubbing out the program, ensuring that unit test cases or other needs are met and maintained throughout development, including the need to do user testing.

*What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?*
This project has not only given me a greater appreciation and understanding of the behind-the-scenes functionality that 3D modelling and real-time engine software packages offer, but it has also helped me refine my understanding of mathematical principles such as matrix math and calculus.

*What design process did you follow for your project work?*
I worked through successive builds of functionality, revising my approach over time as the complexity of the project grew. I implemented several key features for dynamic resource loading and texture assignment, and also leveraged Blender to generate more realistic textures according to the reference 2D image.

*How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?*
It is critical in all projects to identify bottlenecks for performance and code readability/maintainability, some of the techniques I applied in this project will enable me to think more holistically when developing complex solutions in the future. Also, the skills I've developed in OpenGL have direct applicability to real-time visualization and interactions that will be relevant as the XR ecosystem continues to grow. 

**How do I approach developing programs?**

*What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?*
The use of an external tool, Blender, to generate more realistic, procedural textures which I baked to leverage in OpenGL was a new strategy that I look forward to employing more moving forward. Also, some of the debug flags I added to toggle project development readouts and visualizations will likely be really helpful in the future. 

*How did iteration factor into your development?*
As mentioned previously, iteration in the project was key to addressing the changing client needs, and refactoring the solution as those new features were added was crucial. Not only did this approach show progressive expansion of features and mastery, but it also allowed me to rework the architecture as appropriate when I identified bottlenecks in my workflow for development.

*How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?*
My approach to developing code continued to flex as the needs of the project changed. While I was primarily concerned with delivering the core features, I also took extra care to abstract and simplify recurring processes in the codebase. It was also helpful to continue refining my understanding of C++ syntax.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science is an ever-expanding field which impacts every factor of our lives. Even the simplest devices have firmware at the least, and they can control everything from the cars we drive to the shuttles we fly into space. It's critical to continue growing my skills in these areas, identifying my growth opportunities and developing my understanding of new concepts and trends. Mastering computer science can pave the way for powerful personal and professional growth.

*How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?*
While I have some background in 3D modelling and real-time engines, it is helpful to work in a lower level of development related to them. Pairing this deeper knowledge with my broad knowledge in modelling, rendering, rigging, texturing, and game engines will open up new possibilities in problem solving moving forward in work and school.

*How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?*
Computational graphics and visualizations are a critical part of everything from sales to human-machine-interfaces and as time continues, our solutions are only as effective as they are intuitive and refined in both input and representation. These skills will continue to be critical as I move forward in my professional pathway, using tools such as 3D visualization and interaction to solve new problems.
